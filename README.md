===================
This is a simple paint program that can draw 3 shapes in four colors. Rectangle, Oval, and Line. Red, Green, Blue and Black. The User can also decide if the Shape is to be filled with the color or not. The user may undo the action or clear the entire paint. As well as move the recently drawn shapes.
